I'm currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in computational social science at [Web Mining Lab](http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/) and [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/com), City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Dr. Xiaofan Liu](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/com/Profile.aspx?u=xliu347) and [Prof. Jonathan J. H. Zhu](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/com/Profile.aspx?u=enjhzhu). 

My Ph.D. dissertation examines the diffusion process, user sustainability, and social impacts of anonymous communication technologies (e.g. [The Tor Network](https://torproject.org/), commonly known as the [Dark Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web)) using quantitative and computational methods.

Before coming to Hong Kong, I was deeply attracted by computational social science when I was an undergraduate in 2015, since when I started to study social sciences.
